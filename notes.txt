MOVEITCMD Documentation:

The routine files pertinent to the arm are situated in the following directory: ROS/arm_and_chassis_ws/src/common_teleop/routines/s3a/

The extension for these files is .moveitcmd.

The syntax for MOVEITCMD is as follows:
A number is defined as a signed double value.
A vector is defined as a tuple in the format [<number>, <number>] for 2D vectors or [<number>, <number>, <number>] for 3D vectors.
An entity is defined as element from the set {hand, arm}.
'#' denotes a comment. Any text following this character within the same line is disregarded by the interpreter.
'%include <file>' is a directive that instructs the interpreter to replace the directive with the content of the specified file.
'<string> = <vector>' is a variable declaration. The variable is not treated as a constant.
'use <entity>' is a command that switches the control target to the specified entity.
'go <vector>' is a command that moves the control target to the specified vector.
'wait <number>' is a command that pauses the execution for a duration specified by the parameter (in seconds).

Each command is confined to a single line.

Files that commence with an underscore ('_') are not utilized as entry points. Instead, they are included in other files.
